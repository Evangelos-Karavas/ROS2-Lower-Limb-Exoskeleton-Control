# Project hasn't finished yet!

# Complete README coming soon!

This project is a ROS 2 Humble and Ingition Sim for a lower limb exoskeleton, based on the March project (simplified).
It uses pre-trained neural networks (LSTM, CNN) to predict the next gait cycle, to help people with neurological
disorders.

exo_control is still in the works for a conventional PD controller based on phase variable control.
